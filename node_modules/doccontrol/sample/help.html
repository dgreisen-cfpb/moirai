<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Use the same schema in browser and node.js</li>
	<li>Arbitrary nested schemas for easy validation of documents stored in NoSql dbs</li>
	<li>Incredibly flexible; you don't have to use our widgets. simply hook your ui up to the form events</li>
</ul>

<h2>Options</h2>
<dl>
	<dt>WidgetSet</dt>
	<dd>Which widgetSet the form uses to render its fields. Currently:
		<ul><li>Enyo</li><li>Onyx</li></ul>
	</dd>
	<dt>Skin</dt>
	<dd>Which skin to use to display each widget. There are currently two skins; both supported by both widgetSets:
		<ul>
			<li><b>default</b>: traditional form, everything layed out one after the other vertically with nesting for subfields</li>
			<li><b>horizontal</b>: forms arranged so label and form are next to each other.</li>
		</ul>
	</dd>
	<dt>Validation Strategy</dt>
	<dd>How and when to perform automatic validation. Every time the fields in the form change, the validation strategy
		is called. If the validation strategy returns true, the form is validated and errors displayed as appropriate. There are currently two validation strategies:
		<ul>
			<li><b>default</b>: Only start validating after the form has been manually validated once (usually by hitting the submit button)</li>
			<li><b>always</b>: perform validation every time the form changes</li>
		</ul>
	</dd>
	<dt>Instant Validation</dt>
	<dd>While validation strategy determines whether to validate once a change is detected, instant validation determines when to notify the form that a widget value has changed. If true, then the widget will notify the form after every key stroke. If false, it will only notify the form when the widget is left.
	</dd>
